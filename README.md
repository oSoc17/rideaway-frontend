# Rideaway Frontend

Install and run the dev version:
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Compile a production version in the build folder:
```sh
$ npm run prod
```

This project is an excellent demonstration of the power of OSM to support an advanced mobile app that assists in the navigation of cyclists through the Brussel’s regional cycling network.

* Give the cycle network more visibility
* Get the cycle routes more incorporated in the daily life

## Why
Why are people not using the Brussels Cycle Network?
Because they don’t know it exists.
 
We want to make the Brussels Cycling Network more practical and accessible.

## What 
We are creating a tool to explore, plan and navigate the Brussels Cycling Network.
